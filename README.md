# Bachelor of Science in Mathematics - Final Project

This repository contains the python scripts of the final project done by my group in B.Sc. in Mathematics course at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.

The project aims to create a code for a cryptographic method that uses graph theory to encrypt and decrypt text messages, which is then converted to an end-to-end encrypted server-client communication application on the terminal.
